# Description

HandyCraft adds control keys for quickly adding 1 or 5 crafts of a held item or selected entity to the handcrafting queue

> _How is this different than [Craft Under Mouse](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/craft-under-mouse)?_

Both mods allow for quick hand crafting but Craft Under Mouse only works with built entities; HandyCraft expands on this to allow items and item ghosts held in hand to be quick-crafted as well.

## Features

- Press ALT + Q to queue up 5 item crafts, or ALT + SHIFT + Q to queue up a single item craft (key sequences can be modified)
- When holding an item or item ghost in hand, that item will be crafted.  Otherwise, if a buildable entity or entity ghost is selected, then the item for that entity will be crafted.
