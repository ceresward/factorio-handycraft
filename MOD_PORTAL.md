# Description

HandyCraft adds control keys for quickly queueing up one, five or all crafts of a held item or selected entity to the handcrafting queue

> _How is this different than [Craft Under Mouse](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/craft-under-mouse)?_

Both mods allow for quick hand crafting but Craft Under Mouse only works with built entities; HandyCraft expands on this to allow items and item ghosts held in hand to be quick-crafted as well.  Which means it can be activated not just for buildable items such as assemblers and furnaces, but also intermediates like gears and circuits too!

## Features

- Press ALT + Q to queue a single item craft, SHIFT + ALT + Q to queue five item crafts, or CONTROL + SHIFT + ALT + Q to queue all item crafts (key sequences can be customized)
- When holding an item or item ghost in hand, then that item will be crafted.  Otherwise, if a hand-craftable entity or entity ghost is selected, then the item used to place that entity will be crafted.
